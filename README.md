# My ANN for MMA Prediction

This repository contains my first project on artificial neural networking. As this has been an iterative process, I have used a variety of data sets and formats for the neural network. As a result, not all of the data sets or programs in the repository are used in the final product. 

# Logistics
To run the code on your own system, be sure to first change the filepaths used to reference the datasets so that it matches the location at which you save them on your own system. This code is run using Python 3 and requires pandas, numpy, and tensorflow libraries.

# Latest Iteration
The latest format of the model, which generally outputs a predictive accuracy of 66-70% is found at newNN.py. This code references the dataset listed ____.
